Code looks and runs as intended, great use of images to accompany the text, which is also formatted nicely with the stylesheet, and great addition of back button to return to the previous page. The HTML pages could be put in a folder to reduce clutter in the main root folder, and the font weight and size could use a bit of adjustment for some of the text. Other than that, it looks very good.
